# Conser-vision
These are my solutions for the conser-vision challenge on drivendata.org

## Running this code
The code requires heavy compute. Use the following colab notebook to run this code on Google colab GPUs:

## Initialization Point
The idea is to use the pretrained model as an initialization point for our problem

## L<sup>2</sup>-SP
The idea is to use the weights of the pretrained model to penalize the weights of the current model.  
To be added

## DELTA
The idea is to use the feature maps of the pretrained model to penalize the model from forgetting important information from pretraining (forward transfer).  
To be added

## BSS
To be added

## Co-Tuning
The classifier layer of the pretrained model holds value. Co-Tuning is the technique that uses the classifier layer of the pretrained model in transfer learning.
